## 2. How Does an American Express Gift Card Work?

Before we dive into the steps of using your American Express gift card online, it's important to understand how it works.

### Key Features of American Express Gift Cards:
- **Prepaid Nature**: The card functions like a prepaid debit card, meaning it holds a fixed amount of money, and you can use it until the balance is depleted.
- **Accepted Online**: American Express gift cards are widely accepted by many online merchants, including Amazon.
- **Security**: These gift cards are typically equipped with a PIN for added security, which makes them suitable for online transactions.
- **No Monthly Fees**: Unlike some other prepaid cards, American Express gift cards typically don't have any maintenance fees or monthly charges.

### Things to Remember:
- **Expiration Date**: American Express gift cards come with an expiration date, so make sure you use them before they expire.
- **Balance**: The gift card only holds a specific amount, so you'll need to keep track of your balance and ensure it covers your online purchases.
